## Start tracking a project
$ git init
## creates a .git directory in the current directory
## this now is your 'working directory' since it contains the .git directory

## To see what files are tracking and untracked in your working directory
$ git status
##  untracked means Git sees a file that was not in the last snapshot (commit)
## Git does not track such a file until you tell it to do so with an 'add'.

## To begin tracking a file
$ git add <filename>
## this adds it to the tracking list and stages it as part of an index
## the file is staged, ready to be commit to the repository.
